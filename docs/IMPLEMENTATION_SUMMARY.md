# Hybrid Insurance dApp - Claim Submission Workflow Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to implement the new claim submission workflow where buyers submit PDF files for claims, which are then automatically verified and processed.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Models Updated
**File:** `backend/insurance/models.py`

- Updated `Claim` model with new status choices:
  - `verified`
  - `unverified`
  - `accepted`
  - `not_approved`
- Added timestamp fields:
  - `verified_at`: When the claim was verified
  - `accepted_at`: When the claim was accepted by admin
- Fixed `Buyer` model [created_at](file://f:\web3\hybrid_Insurance%20_reviced\backend\insurance\models.py#L149-L149) field to allow null values for existing records

### 2. Views Updated
**File:** `backend/insurance/views.py`

- Implemented `submit_claim` endpoint to:
  - Handle PDF file uploads
  - Extract transaction IDs from PDF content
  - Automatically verify transactions with the billing API
  - Create claims with appropriate status tags
- Added `verify_transaction_id` function to call the verification API
- Added `extract_transaction_id_from_pdf` function to parse PDF files
- Implemented `admin_update_claim_status` endpoint to handle claim approval/rejection
- Updated `get_buyer_history` to include status messages
- Added `get_claim_status_message` helper function

### 3. Dependencies Updated
**File:** `backend/requirements.txt`

- Added PyPDF2 library for PDF processing

### 4. Migrations
**File:** `backend/insurance/migrations/0006_claim_verification_fields.py`

- Created migration to update database schema with new fields and choices

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Buyer Dashboard
**File:** `frontend/src/components/BuyerDashboard.tsx`

- Updated claim submission form to handle PDF file uploads
- Modified submission process to use the new backend endpoint
- Added claim history section showing status messages
- Implemented real-time feedback on claim submission process

### 2. Admin Dashboard
**File:** `frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx`

- Enhanced claim listing with verification status badges
- Updated action buttons for claim approval/rejection
- Improved status visualization with color-coded tags
- Added support for new claim statuses

## API Endpoints

### New/Updated Endpoints

1. **POST `/submit-claim/`**
   - Handles PDF file upload
   - Extracts transaction ID from PDF
   - Automatically verifies transaction with billing API
   - Creates claim with appropriate status tag

2. **POST `/admin/update-claim-status/`**
   - Allows admins to accept or reject claims
   - Updates claim status and timestamps

3. **GET `/buyer-history/<wallet_address>/`**
   - Updated to include status messages for claims

## Workflow Implementation

### Claim Submission Process
1. Buyer uploads a PDF file with claim details
2. System extracts transaction ID from PDF content
3. System automatically calls verification API:
   - `http://127.0.0.1:8000/billing/api/verify-transaction/<transaction_id>/`
4. Based on API response:
   - **Success**: Claim tagged as "verified"
   - **Failure**: Claim tagged as "unverified"
5. Claim appears in admin dashboard with appropriate status

### Admin Processing
1. Admin reviews claims in dashboard
2. Admin can approve or reject claims:
   - **Approve**: Status changes to "accepted"
   - **Reject**: Status changes to "not_approved"

### Buyer Notifications
1. Buyers see status updates in their dashboard:
   - "✅ Claim approved" when accepted
   - "❌ Claim not approved" when rejected
2. Claim history shows appropriate status tags

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Submit a claim with a PDF containing a valid transaction ID
2. Verify the claim appears in admin dashboard with correct status
3. Approve/reject the claim as admin
4. Check buyer dashboard for appropriate status messages

### Edge Cases Handled
- Invalid PDF files are rejected
- Missing transaction IDs in PDFs are handled gracefully
- API failures during verification are handled
- Network timeouts are managed with appropriate error messages

## Deployment Instructions

1. Install new dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

2. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. Restart the backend server

## Future Improvements

1. Enhanced PDF parsing with more robust regex patterns
2. Support for additional document formats
3. Improved error handling for various PDF structures
4. Async processing for better performance with large files
